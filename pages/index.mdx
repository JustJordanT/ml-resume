# Jordan Taylor (JT)

Hey, I'm a Senior Platform Engineering at Basistheory, where I've built a solid base in platform, and software engineering foundations.
Along the way, I started diving into the exciting world of Machine Learning (ML) and MLOps. This is my learning in the open so that I am able to showcase my progress into ML.
